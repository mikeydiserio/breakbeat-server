basic af Node Server Using Express  to serve a list of common breakbeat samples through HTTP requests using REST.

breakbeats.json is the DB file, currently manually editing this file is the official way to update this

when adding a new breakbeat, ensure you add the associated sample file in the 'sounds' folder
